# lawebagi - Meeting AI Assistant

## Description

lawebagi is an open-source project designed to be a legal and ethical meeting AI assistant. It provides functionalities for audio capture and transcription, summarization and question answering, all while prioritizing user privacy and ethical considerations.

## Features

*   **Audio Capture and Transcription:** Utilizes existing libraries or APIs for speech-to-text conversion (e.g., Whisper, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text). Implements local-only audio recording and processing for enhanced privacy.
*   **Summarization and Question Answering:** Explores open-source LLMs or integrates with cloud-based LLM APIs like Google Gemini to summarize meetings, extract action items, key decisions, and perform sentiment analysis. Allows users to ask specific questions about meeting content and receive relevant answers.
*   **Privacy Enhancements:** Prioritizes local-only processing, robust data encryption, and access controls for meeting recordings and transcripts. Ensures users have clear control over their data, including storage, deletion, and sharing preferences.
*   **User Interface:** Offers a user-friendly interface (web-based or desktop application) for interacting with lawebagi. Allows users to upload meeting recordings or transcripts, generate summaries, extract action items, and ask questions. Provides clear visual indicators regarding the AI's processing and potential limitations.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

*   **Consent:** Ensure that all meeting participants consent to having the meeting recorded, transcribed, and processed by the AI.
*   **Data Handling:** Adhere to strict data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable) when collecting, storing, and processing meeting data.
*   **Bias Mitigation:** Actively work to minimize biases in the AI models used for transcription and summarization.
*   **Disclosures:** Clearly communicate to users how the AI works, its limitations, and how their data is handled.
