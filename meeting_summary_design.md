# Meeting Summarization and Question Answering Design Document

## 1. Overview
This system is designed to process meeting transcripts and perform two main operations:
- Summarize meeting content to extract action items, key decisions, and analyze sentiment.
- Provide a question answering (QA) layer that allows users to ask specific questions about the meeting content and receive relevant answers.

## 2. LLM Integration Options
### Open-Source Options
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Use models like BERT, GPT variants which can be fine-tuned on summarization or QA tasks.
- **LLAMA or BLOOM:** These models can be adapted for summarization and QA with additional fine-tuning.

### Cloudâ€‘Based Options
- **Google Gemini:** Explore available API endpoints for text summarization and question answering.
- **Other Providers:** Consider options such as OpenAI or Azure Cognitive Services if they meet requirements.

## 3. Summarization Prompts
The LLM should be prompted with instructions that include:
- **Context:** Provide the meeting transcript.
- **Task Instructions:**  
  - Extract high-level action items.
  - Identify key decisions.
  - Analyze overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Example Prompt:**  
  "Summarize the following meeting transcript by listing all action items, key decisions taken, and providing a sentiment analysis."

## 4. Meeting Transcript QA
### Workflow
- **Indexing:** Store and index meeting transcripts in a searchable database or a vector database.
- **Query Processing:**  
  When a user asks a question, retrieve related segments of the transcript.
- **Answer Construction:**  
  Use the LLM to generate answers based on relevant context.

### Q&A Prompt Template Example
"Given the following meeting transcript excerpts, answer the question: '<user question>'. Focus on providing clear, concise details from the transcript."

## 5. Architecture and Data Flow
1. **Input Stage:** Meeting transcript is uploaded.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean the transcript and split into segments.
3. **Summarization:** Use the summarization prompt with an LLM to generate summary content.
4. **Indexing/Storage:** Store the transcript and the summary in a searchable format.
5. **Question Answering:**  
   - Receive a query from the user.
   - Execute a search (e.g., vector search) to locate relevant transcript segments.
   - Provide these segments as context to the QA prompt.
6. **Output:** Return the answer to the user.

## 6. Evaluation
- **Accuracy of Summaries:** Compare LLM-generated summaries with human-generated notes.
- **QA Relevance:** Ensure that the answers directly address the user's questions.
- **Performance Testing:** Evaluate latency especially when using cloud-based LLMs.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Incorporate user feedback loops to refine the summarization prompts.
- Extend the QA mechanism to support follow-up questions using conversational context.
- Evaluate additional LLM providers to optimize costs and response quality.
